It is the joint action that emerges when speakers and listeners, writers and readers perform their individual actions in coordination, as ensembles. In contrast to work within the cognitive sciences, which has seen language use as an individual process, and to work within the social sciences, which has seen it as a social process, the author argues strongly that language use embodies both individual and social processes.},

@article{citeulike:346448,
    abstract = {Grammatical Framework ({GF}) is a special-purpose functional language for defining grammars. It uses a Logical Framework ({LF}) for a description of abstract syntax, and adds to this a notation for defining concrete syntax. {GF} grammars themselves are purely declarative, but can be used both for linearizing syntax trees and parsing strings. {GF} can describe both formal and natural languages. The key notion of this description is a grammatical object, which is not just a string, but a record that contains all information on inflection and inherent grammatical features such as number and gender in natural languages, or precedence in formal languages. Grammatical objects have a type system, which helps to eliminate run-time errors in language processing. In the same way as a {LF}, {GF} uses dependent types in abstract syntax to express semantic conditions, such as well-typedness and proof obligations. Multilingual grammars, where one abstract syntax has many parallel concrete syntaxes, can be used for reliable and meaning-preserving translation. They can also be used in authoring systems, where syntax trees are constructed in an interactive editor similar to proof editors based on {LF}. While being edited, the trees can simultaneously be viewed in different languages. This paper starts with a gradual introduction to {GF}, going through a sequence of simpler formalisms till the full power is reached. The introduction is followed by a systematic presentation of the {GF} formalism and outlines of the main algorithms: partial evaluation and parser generation. The paper concludes by brief discussions of the Haskell implementation of {GF}, existing applications, and related work.},

We also show how this approach can lead to better engineering of dialog management components of dialog systems, allowing for separate development of modular system fundamentals, dialog theories, and domain-specific dialogue systems, in a manner where components can more easily be reused. TrindiKit is a tool instantiating the lowest level, and allowing straightforward implementation of dialog theories formalized using the information state approach. We briefly describe several dialog systems built using TrindiKit, and how components have been successfully further developed and reused in other projects.},
