"""
ML - Machine Learning component for the Language Unit
=====================================================

The purpose of this package is to provide classes and functions to store and
retrieve learned information about the language.

This information includes
   * Frequency count for each chunk
   * Class-conditional probability for each chunk
   * Alignment score for each couple of chunks
   
Some assumptions are made throughout the package, that may or may not need 
future review:
   * Quantities are symmetric (c1,c2)=(c2,c1). This is achieved by ordering
     c1 and c2 alphabetically before accessing the index. Also, when two scores
     are possible, the average is considered.
   * Chunks are indexed by their text content, other properties (eg. position
     in sentence, POS tag, etc.) are ignored.
     
     TODO: it would be nice to implement it replacing Python get/set methods, 
           rather then taking the text from the Chunk in every function
