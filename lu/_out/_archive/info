01-cur: output files in the LU folders at the end of summer
02-cur2: fresh generated output, without changing the pre-summer code.
         Only modification was the add of the MAX cache chunk count value and
         the ml.core.get_c_frequency_norm() method, which is however never used
03-cnorm: Chunk frequency replaced with Normalized chunk frequency
04-anorm: Alignment frequency normalized per chunk. One parsing with old ml data,
          one with re-trained system
