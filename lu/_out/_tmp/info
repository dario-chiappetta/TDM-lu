Chronological index of the ml parameters' changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Default: alignment score as average: ( (m/tm1) + (m/tm2) ) / 2

as_shared: alignment score as shared mass: return 2*m/(tm1+tm2)

5pass_def1: 5-times parsing, default score is 1

nosimm: m(a,b) != m(b,a)
 finally "the volume" vs "the volume" gets higher score than "the volume" vs "volume"
 
100pass: 100-times parsing
 "the volume" case: more mass but same proportions

lastry: last during meeting
 10 passes
 pump up the volume

noid: c1=c2 not included in index (default score 1)

as_shared2: = as_shared

part_simmetry: ml score is average of two possible, but only one side is
 reinforced
 
 "increase the volume please" vs "increase the volume": bad ml score, because
   "increase the volume" is present in index with other fragments
 
 "increase the volume please" vs "decrease the volume": good score, because one
  part of the average is 1
 
simmetry: success!

ml2-20p: proper machine learning (label by label, cyclical update)
         20 em passes

ml2-100p: 100 empasses
 not so different, also because the training set is small and not diverse enough
