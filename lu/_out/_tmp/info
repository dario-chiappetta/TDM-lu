Default: alignment score as average: ( (m/tm1) + (m/tm2) ) / 2

as_shared: alignment score as shared mass: return 2*m/(tm1+tm2)

5pass_def1: 5-times parsing, default score is 1

nosimm: m(a,b) != m(b,a)
 finally "the volume" vs "the volume" gets higher score than "the volume" vs "volume"
 
100pass: 100-times parsing
 "the volume" case: more mass but same proportions
